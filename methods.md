# Methods used (self implemented) 
- VAD model
- Deep audio embeddings methods(using CNN)
- Deep audio embeddings methods(using LSTM)
- Spectral clustering 
- Dataset generation
- GANMM + Spectral clustering based upsampling


# Methods used (using available libraries)

- VAD library (webrtcvad)
- Spectral clustering 
- KNN
- GMM
- Librosa for mfcc feature extraction

Note: For some methods, we use both self implemented and libraries. And for fast implentation we preferred libraries directly.
Kindly find the attached code for all the self implemnted methods.
